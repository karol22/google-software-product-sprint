      <h1>Hi, I'm Karol</h1>
      <p>
        I am a senior Computer Science student from Mexico. I study at Tecnol√≥gico
        de Monterrey in Guadalajara.
        My main interests are programming and mathematics. I love to build things 
        from scratch and learn new things. I want to develop something that helps 
        many people as well as bring technology to the youth of Mexico.
